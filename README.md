# Hypergraph Networks
Hypergraph Networks is an extension of [Graph Nets](https://github.com/deepmind/graph_nets) 
by Google DeepMind to hypergraphs, implemented in PyTorch.

## Progress
The Hypergraph Networks library is currently under testing and will be released in the near
future. For earlier access, please contact

### What is a hypergraph?
A [hypergraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraph) is a graph where there are 
hyperedges that can join any number of vertices. It is easy to observe that a hypergraph
is a generalisation of a normal graph, as a hypergraph where each hyperedge is of size
2 is just a normal graph.
